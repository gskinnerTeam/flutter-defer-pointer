An alternative to Overlay which allows you to easily render and hit test a widget outside its parent bounds.

Typically in Flutter, if you offset a widget outside of it's parent bounds hit-testing will break.

DeferPointer works around this issue by deferring hit-testing and (optionally) rendering to an ancestor widget further up the tree. This is useful for larger UI components like dropdown menus and sliding panels, as well as just small styling tweaks.

Note: This package is based on the original idea by @shrouxm here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/75747#issuecomment-907755810

## 🔨 Installation
```yaml
dependencies:
  defer_pointer: ^0.0.1+4
```

### ⚙ Import

```dart
import 'package:defer_pointer/defer_pointer.dart';
```

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Wrap a `DeferredPointerHandler` somewhere above the buttons that you wish to hit-test.
2. Wrap `DeferPointer` around the buttons themselves.
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DeferredPointerHandler(
       child: SizedBox(
           width: 100,
           height: 100,
           child: Stack(clipBehavior: Clip.none, children: [
             // Hang button off the bottom of the content
             Positioned(
               bottom: -30,
               child: DeferPointer(child: _SomeBtn(false)),
             ),
             // Content
             Positioned.fill(
               child: Container(
                 decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.green, boxShadow: [
                   BoxShadow(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(1), blurRadius: 4, spreadRadius: 4),
                 ]),
               ),
             ),
           ]))));
  }
```

Enable `paintOnTop` if you need the child Widget painted on top of it's siblings. This will defer painting to the currently linked `DeferredPointerHandler`.
```dart
return DeferPointer(
    paintOnTop: true,
    child: TextButton(...));
```

### Examples
There are 4 examples in this repo:

1. A simple example of offsetting 2 buttons outside their stack:
https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-defer-pointer/blob/master/example/lib/examples/simple_offset_outside_parent.dart

2. A classic desktop/web style dropdown menu:
https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-defer-pointer/blob/master/example/lib/examples/dropdown_menus.dart

3. A animated menu based on the `Flow` widget: 
https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-defer-pointer/blob/master/example/lib/examples/flow_menu.dart

4. A auto-complete search field:
https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-defer-pointer/blob/master/example/lib/examples/auto_complete.dart

### Manual Linking
By default a `DeferPointer` widget will look up the closest `DeferredPointerHandler` using it's current context. For more complicated use cases you can manually assign a link to bind a pointer to a handler:
```dart
final _deferredPointerLink = DeferredPointerHandlerLink();
...
Widget build(){
    return DeferredPointerHandler(
      link: _deferredPointerLink,
      child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
          child: DeferPointer(
            link: _deferredPointerLink,
            child: ...,
          )),
    );
}
```
